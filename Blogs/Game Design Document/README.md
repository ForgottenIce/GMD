# Slime Forest: Arcade Adventure - Game Design Document
This is my GDD (Game Design Document). The content of this document is subject to change, as it is hard to predict exactly what should be worked on ahead of time (SPOILERS: My milestones have changed quite a bit). Check the [Git history](https://github.com/ForgottenIce/GMD/commits/main/Blogs/Game%20Design%20Document/README.md) of this document if you are curious.

## The General Ideas for My Game
- It's a 2D platformer
- Focus on tight controls (with inspiration from games like Celeste, SMW kaizo ROM hacks, IWBTG-fangames & Hollow Knight).
- Unlockable movement abilites that makes it possible to progress in new areas as well as previous areas.
- Maybe metroidvania (as in, one big explorable level)? If that isn't feasible it will be level-based progression instead.

## Milestone 1: A Test Level With a Playable Character
For the first milestone, my aim is to have a playable character with most of the moveset completed. The main focus is to experiment and find a control set that feels satistfying. There will also be a focus on creating the unlockable movement abilities, as well as other game object that the player can interact with (such as jump pads, dash orbs, etc.). A testing area will be built to test these things.

## Milestone 2: Player Sprites, Gameplay Elements & Level Building
This milestone will focus on implementing sprites for the different states the player can be in (idle, run, jump, dashing, etc.). There will also be a focus on implementing gameplay elements (like jump orbs, trampolines, etc.). And lastly, I will try and create the first level of the game.

## Milestone 3: State Machine, Enemies & UI Elements 
In this milestone, I would like to implement a state machine system. The player's movement script should be refactored to use this system. There will also be a focus on creating at least one enemy for the game, which could also be built using the state machine. Lastly, there will be a focus on implementing some UI elements.
