# [INSERT GAME TITLE] - Game Design Document

## The General Ideas for My Game
- It's a 2D platformer
- Focus on tight controls (with inspiration from games like Celeste, SMW kaizo ROM hacks, IWBTG-fangames & Hollow Knight).
- Unlockable movement abilites that makes it possible to progress in new areas as well as previous areas.
- Maybe metroidvania (as in, one big explorable level)? If that isn't feasible it will be level-based progression instead.

## Milestone 1: A Test Level With a Playable Character
For the first milestone, my aim is to have a playable character with most of the moveset completed. The main focus is to experiment and find a control set that feels satistfying. There will also be a focus on creating the unlockable movement abilities, as well as other game object that the player can interact with (such as jump pads, dash orbs, etc.). A testing area will be built to test these things.

## Milestone 2 (preliminary): Creating the Game World & Levels
Here the focus will be around creating the levels (or maybe one big level metroidvania-like?). I will have to figure out how you progress in the game. The current plan is to make levels/areas that each  focuses on specific movement-based gimmicks that the player unlocks along the way.

## Milestone 3 (preliminary): Visuals & Polishing
This milestone is a bit vague at the moment, but the idea is that the game is somewhat finished at this stage and that this last milestone focuses on making the game feel more finished.
