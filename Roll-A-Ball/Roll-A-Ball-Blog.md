# Roll a Ball Blog
Welcome to my first blog post in the GMD course! In this first project, I followed the [Roll-a-Ball](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball) tutorial from Unity. I started off completing the tutorial with a 1:1 clone of the game that was made in the tutorial. Then later on, I made some additional changes myself.
